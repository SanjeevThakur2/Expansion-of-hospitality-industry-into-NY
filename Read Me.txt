Data Assumptions:
1. All units in the dataset are residential units only
2. Price is equivalent to revenue
3. I have made assumptions to answer business questions (considering the perspective of a business client ) with appropriate formatting and data storytelling.
4. I have included one line of code to install the geopy module, assuming that it is not installed in your system. In case it is already installed in your system, then I  request you to #comment the first line (in the jupyter notebook).
5. I have tried to answer all the questions instead of just 5 so please go through both the tableau file and ppt fully.


Scope:
1. Applicable for only NYC State due to data limitations.
2. Only residential units (the type of which found in Airbnb) are covered under this analysis
3. Hotels are out of scope for this dataset as the airbnb data is from the period where they did not list hotels.
Limitations:
1. Insights gathered from airbnb data as such will be subjected to the same limitations within the airbnb data
2. Due to some missing values and some outliers present in the dataset, I have tried to make the best guess to fix missing values. It is not 100% accurate but is very close to it.
3. Lack of data on residential and commercial units forced a few assumptions to answer the questions.
